SHORT DESCRIPTION

    PowerShell library for HPE OneView 10.00

WHAT'S NEW

   Release 10.00.4265.2221

      -- Initial HPE OneView 10.00 library release.
      -- Enhanced Set-OVApplianceAuditLogForwarding to support TCP/TLS in addition to
         UDP for defining destination.
      -- Fixed Get-OVIloSso Cmdlet when requesting a valid iLO Redfish/REST API
         connection object.  Cmdlet no longer attempts connection to iLO to generate or
         validate SSO token.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    This library provides HP OneView management capabilities for Windows PowerShell.
    The library can be used as either a CLI or using the core cmdlets to call from
    wrapper scripts.  The core cmdlets are:

      -- Connect-OVMgmt
      -- Send-OVRequest
      -- New-OVResource
      -- Set-OVResource
      -- Remove-OVResource

    A set of sample scripts are also provided, that show how to fully configure an
    HP OneView appliance from the ground up.
